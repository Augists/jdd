CHANGES:
--------

This is the list of the latest changes in the JDD source.
It is based on the major build number, not versions numbers etc.


============ 106:
REMOVED:
    data files for the stuff removed in 105

============ 105:
REMOVED:
    SAT and DES and graph theory stuff
    profiler
    tutorials


============ pending
ADDED:
	The Flags class will hopefully make the code more readable :)
	
CHANGED:
	The XML files now can start with a <Document> top-node. this allows us to include multiple types of data in a single XML file. Such files can then be loaded in JDD and DescoGUI but not in Supremica :(
	The XML loaders are have now state information for more correct translation.
	The automaton Event class will store its flags in a Flag object instead of booleans

FIXED:

============ 101:
ADDED:
	the Fibonacci example :)
	
CHANGED:
	SimpleCache now uses a monolithic array
	
FIXED:
	NodeTable grow() bug introduced in build 100 is gone now.

============ Build 100:
ADDED:
 * The Mersenne Twister PRNG (and more to come)
 * better profiling support.
 * Automata+BDD operations are more advanced now. added automata ordering + disj/conj partitioning and search
 * The AGV model is now also included as a Petri net
 * Node makring can now use a non-recursive method
 
CHANGED
 * new BED code added
 * node-table access refactored.  
 * Node-table now uses a double linked list instead of a hash-table.
 * Hash functions cleaned up and moved to their own class
 * the graph package has been moved from jdd.util.graph to jdd.graph
 * ZDD stuff now use the new cache classes (OptimizedCache instead of Cache)
 * ZDD code follows the standard of the BDD codes more now (e.g. Configuration stuff)

FIXED
 * minor bug in NodeTable (compressed array resizing)
 
============ Build 99:
CHANGED
 * OptimizedCache simplified and in use again (for BDDs at least)
 * BDDIO now saves BDDs with gzip compression. minor bug fixes
 * code cleaned up to remove some of those stupid jikes warnings
 
 
============ Build 98:

CHANGED:
 * the tests are moved from main() to internal_test()
 * we are now using ANT instead of nmake (finally)


============ Build 97:

ADDED:
 * SimpleCache divided into two files: SimpleCache and OptimizedCache.
   Reason: "optimization is the mother of evil"
 * BDDIO added for loading /saving BDDs.
 
FIXED:
 * MAJOR performance bug in the cache structure fixed (we hope :)

CHANGED:
 * a small performance improvement in NodeHT by changing the hash function.
 * small performance improvement in Simple/Optimized Cache by migrating CUDDs hash function.
